This project ist a backup of my personal keyboard setup for Windows.

Keyboard Layout
---------------

The keyboard layout is based on the Apple US International keyboard layout, which
is exactly like the usual US layout until alt gr is used. Many keys using alt gr are
mapped to dead keys, making it possible to enter accents for many letters. Examples:

alt+s: ß
alt+e: grave accent (before aeiou → áéíóú)
alt+u: umlaut (before aeou → äëöü)
alt+j: double grave accent (before ou → őű)

Scancode Map
------------

The registry files in the scancode map folder are used to disable the caps lock and
windows keys. The left alt works like the right alt (ie. alt gr), and the normal alt
key is mapped onto the windows keys.
